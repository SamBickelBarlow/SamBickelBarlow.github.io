        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a data-driven professional pursuing an M.P.A. in Data Science for Public Policy at the London School of Economics, with a background in economics, public policy, and history. 
            My experience spans Medicare policy research and government contract consulting, where I analyzed complex datasets and helped develop evidence-based recommendations for government stakeholders and clients.
            I am motivated by a desire to leverage advanced data science techniques to address global challenges in public health and other policy areas.
