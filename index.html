                I have created these charts using thee chart creation tool on the Economics Observatory website.
                Chart 1 shows the low unemployment rate in Thailand since 1992.
                Chart 2 shows the relatively higher unemploymeent rate in nearby Bangladesh over the same period.

                Chart 1: New York Times: This chart plots the median age of a population on the x-axis for against the average age of legislatures against on the y-axis a number of countries. The United States is highlighted as an extreme example.
                Chart 2: My recreation of the New York Times' chart. I approximated the data from the New York Times chart and then recreated a close approximation in VegaLite.
                Chart 3: My improvement of the New York Times' chart. Rather than a scatter plot with the x-axis as the the median population age and the y-axis as the average of the legislature, I have calculated the ratio of the age of legisature to the median population age. I have also added a horizontal line to show the ratio at which the average legislature age and median population age are even so that it is easy to tell which countries have older and younger legislatures than their average. I have also retained highlighting of the United States. I believe my chart better gets to the central arguement that many legislatures, the US in particular, represent are much older than their constituents and therefore constitute a gerontocracy where older members of society are overrepresented.

        <h2>Section 5: Scraper. Implement a data scraper of your own. (CC5)</h2>
            <p>
                The OECD published a report detailing the state of space economoy in December 2023. 
                This report included tables for 10 countries with statististics like the Number of satellites the country has in orbit, number of spaceports within the country, the size of the country's space workforce, and the public budget for space exploration and actvities per capita. 
                I scraped the data for each country in the report to create the charts below. Because the OECD report included public space budget in per capita terms, I also used World Bank data on population the population of each country to back into the budget.
                The charts reveal that the United Kingdom is a consistent outlier in terms of budget efficiency with the most satellites, spaceports and workforce per dollar of public budget. These charts suggest that further investigation should be done to understand why the United Kingdom is such an outlier on this regard.

        <h2>Section 7: FEMA claims by US county (CC7)</h2>
            <p>
                I created a cloropleth map based on FEMA subapplication claims data. 
                It shows the total subapplication claims for the hazard category with the highest claims in each US county by year.
                This map gives a sense of where types hazards the most costly in the US. One suprise is the high flooding cost in the counties of a dry and water scare state like Arizona. This may require further investigation to understand why this is.
