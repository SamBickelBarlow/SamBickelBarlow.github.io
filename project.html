        <h2>Aims</h2>
            <p>
             One of most daunting environmental challenges is the increasing threat to freshwater resources. In many ways water is the most critical natural resource on the planet. Losing access to it is devastating for economic activity and for some regions habitability itself. Failing to address a growing water crisis has consequences not only for the regions where water resources are under the most pressure, but also for the whole world as the displacements resulting from lack of access have negative impacts on global stability. With this project I aim to identify the areas and people that are currently under the most pressure. Identification of the most vulnerable is critical to targeting policy interventions that address or at least alleviate pressure water resources.

        <h2>Data Sources</h2>
            <p>
             To create the visualisations used in this project I have relied three sources of data:<br><br>

•	The United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO’s) AQUASTAT database. This database includes over 180 country-level statistics relating to water resources and their use. This database stretches from 1960 through 2021, however, more recent data is more complete especially in developing parts of the world.<br>
•	The World Health Organisation and United Nations Children’s Emergency Funds (WHO/UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene (JMP). This course includes reported country, regional and global estimates of progress on drinking water, sanitation and hygiene since 1990. JMP data has been updated through 2022.<br>
•	The Global Water Monitor. A resource developed by a consortium of universities and research organisations that leverages data from ground stations and satellites to produce up-to-date information on rainfall, air temperature and humidity, soil water, river flows and the volume of water bodies.<br>

            <h2>How has the world's terrestrial water storage changed in the past decade?</h2>
        </div>
        <figure id="Chart4"></figure>

         <b>Source:</b> <a href="https://www.globalwater.online/global-water/index.html">Global Water Monitor</a> <br><br>
         <b>Aims:</b><br>
            My goal with this chart is to show how global freshwater stores have changed over the past two decades.<br><br>
         <b>Data:</b><br>
             Terrestrial water storage, including groundwater, soil water, surface water, snow and land ice, are derived from gravity measurements by the GRACE satellites (Boergens et al., 2019).
         The dataset does not show absolute terrestrial water storage levels. Instead it shows terrestrial water storage as the difference from the 2003-2006 average.<br><br>
         <b>Approach:</b><br>
             To create the chart above I downloaded monthy global data from the Global Water Monitor storage going back to April 2002. I the performed minimal data cleaning to split the date column into separate month and year columns.
         I plotted the data as a line chart with terrestrial water storage on the y-axis, the month on the x-axis and each year of data plotted as a separate line with the shade of blue of the line distinguishing the year (darker blue for more recent years).
         I decided to plot the data in this way to highlight the general but not uniform trend of decreasing global terrestrial water storage over time and the particular low storage amounts measured in 2023. This approach made the general downward trend of terrestrial water storage clear, but to ensure individual points could be investigated I added an interactive tooltip function.<br><br>
         <b>Challenges:</b><br>
             One challenge I faced is that there were some months in this data set that were missing data. At first these missing observations were interpreted by vegaLite as zero values. To instead simply not plot these points I had to eliminate those missing observations before plotting.<br><br>
         <b>Conclusion:</b><br>
             Freshwater resources (measured as terrestriaal water storage) have generally declined over the past two decades. This confirms concerns raised by researchers that pressure on water resources is a growing concern.<br>

            <h2>Which sectors of economies are the biggest contributors to water stress?</h2>
            <p>
             Chart 3 which sectors contribute most to water stress. In most regions, with the exception of North America and Europe, agricultural water use dominates freshwater stress contribution.<br>
             While agriculture is naturally a water intensive economic activity, focusing on increasing efficient use of water in this sector could may pay the biggest dividends for policymakers interested in mitigating water shortages.
