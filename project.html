        <h2>Aims</h2>
        <p>
            This project aims to explore and highlight the growing water crisis affecting different regions of the world. 
            Through interactive visualizations, I set out to analyze trends in water resources, examine the pressures on freshwater supplies, and identify key areas where water scarcity is most critical. 
            My primary goals are to understand how terrestrial water storage has changed over time, determine which countries face the greatest water stress, and examine the role of water efficiency and economic activity in this crisis. 
            Additionally, I aim to investigate the urban-rural divide in access to freshwater and the main sectors contributing to water stress across different regions.

        <h2>Data Sources</h2>
            <p>
             The visualizations in this project draw from three primary sources of data. 
             First, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) AQUASTAT database provides country-level statistics related to water resources, spanning several decades. 
             Second, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) offers data on water access, sanitation, and hygiene from 1990 to the present. 
             Finally, the Global Water Monitor, which uses satellite and ground station data, offers real-time measurements of water levels, including rainfall, temperature, and river flows. These datasets provide insights into water availability, water use efficiency, and the impacts of water stress on global populations.<br>

        <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>
             To create the interactive visualisations, I utilized data processing tools Python and Vega-Lite. 
             For example, to visualise the change in global terrestrial water storage, I gathered data from the Global Water Monitor, cleaned it, and displayed it as a line chart illustrating the downward trend in freshwater resources over the last two decades. 
             In the case of mapping water stress by country, I merged AQUASTAT data with a geoJSON file, carefully addressing discrepancies in country names using a Python package. I also built scatter plots to examine the relationship between GDP per capita and water stress or water use efficiency. 
             Throughout the project, I employed interactive tools, including tooltips, drop-down menus, and sliders, to allow users to explore data points in detail and gain better insights into trends over time.

         <b>Source:</b> <a href="https://www.globalwater.online/global-water/index.html">Global Water Monitor</a> <br><br>
         <b>Aims:</b><br>
            To show how global freshwater stores have changed over the past two decades.<br><br>
         <b>Data:</b><br>
             Terrestrial water storage, including groundwater, soil water, surface water, snow and land ice, are derived from gravity measurements by the GRACE satellites (Boergens et al., 2019).
             The dataset does not show absolute terrestrial water storage levels. Instead it shows terrestrial water storage as the difference from the 2003-2006 average.<br><br>
         <b>Approach:</b><br>
             To create the chart above I downloaded monthy global data from the Global Water Monitor storage going back to April 2002. I performed minimal data cleaning to split the date column into separate month and year columns.
             I plotted the data as a line chart with terrestrial water storage on the y-axis, the month on the x-axis and each year of data plotted as a separate line with the shade of blue of the line distinguishing the year (darker blue for more recent years).
             I decided to plot the data in this way to highlight the general but not uniform trend of decreasing global terrestrial water storage over time and the particular low storage amounts measured in 2023. This approach made the general downward trend of terrestrial water storage clear, but to ensure individual points could be investigated I added an interactive tooltip function.<br><br>
         <b>Challenges:</b><br>
             One challenge I faced is that there were some months in this data set that were missing data. At first these missing observations were interpreted by vegaLite as zero values. 
             To instead simply not plot these points I had to eliminate those missing observations before plotting.<br><br>
         <b>Conclusion:</b><br>
             Freshwater resources (measured as terrestrial water storage) have generally declined over the past two decades. 
             This confirms concerns raised by researchers that pressure on water resources is a growing concern.
             This chart also highlights the seasonal nature of terrestrial water storage which peaks globally around April before decline to a low point in October. 
             Policymakers may choose to focus water relief efforts in the late summer to autumn seasons.<br>

            Source: <a href="https://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/databases/">United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) AQUASTAT</a><br><br>
         <b>Aims:</b><br>
            My goals with this map are to show where water resources are most strained around the world and to show where strain on those resources has improved or gotten worse in the past two decades.<br><br>
         <b>Data:</b><br>
             The data for this charts come from the UN-FAO AQUASTAT data.
             Water stress is essentually the ratio of the water a country uses to the amount it has. See <a href="https://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/databases/glossary/">FAO glossary</a> for detailed metric definitions.
             One limitation of this dataset is that is is only availible at a country-level. This can washout variation within large countries, with varying climates. 
             For example, the United States' dry southwest region struggles with water shortage, while more temperate regions of the US have plenty of water. This varitaion is lost in the country-level water stress statistic.<br><br>
         <b>Approach:</b><br>
             I want to show geographic variation in both absolute levels of water stress as well as the change in water stress over the past two decades. I employeed a map to show this geographic variation in water stress.
             To create this map I first downloaded and cleaned AQUASTAT data on water stress for all countries in 2001 and in 2021 in Python. I then calculated the absolute and percent change in water stress in each country between those years. 
             Once the data was cleaned I used vegaLite to display the: water stress in 2021 and 2001 and the absolute and percentage change in water stress between those years depending on the statistic selected in a drop down menu. 
             These statistics were represented by a color gradient from blue to red to represent countries with good and improving water stress and those with poor and declining water stress respectively.
             Additionally, I added an interactive tooltip so that viewers can see exact statistics for countries.
             <br><br>
         <b>Challenges:</b><br>
            I used a <a href="https://github.com/mclass-user/mclass-user.github.io/blob/main/maps/map_world.geojson">geojson file</a> from 'mclass-user' on Github as the base for my map. 
            This geojson file used International Organization of Standards 3 (ISO3) codes along with country names to identify individual countries. However, the AQUASTAT data only used country names and in many cases the country names were not an exact match between the two data sets.
            For example, one dataset used 'United States' while the other used 'United States of America'.
            To resolve this I imported the AQUASTAT data into Python and used a package called <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pycountry/">pycountry</a> to assist in coverting the AQUASTAT country names into ISO3 codes. 
            This package searches through the most commonly used country names to find a match and can output the matching ISO3 code. This package along with a few hand corrected cases allowed me to successfully link the AQUASTAT data to the geojson based on ISO3 code.<br><br>
         <b>Conclusion:</b><br>
             The Northern Africa and Western Asia are and have been the region of the world with the most critical water stress. Water stress in the region dwarfs water stres in all other countries.
             This is not all that suprising considering the region is know for it's arid and desert climates.
             Examining the change in water stress between 2001 and 2021 we can see that in most countries water stress is getting worse. 
             This could be due increased demand as populations grow and economic activity increase combined with reduced supply due the the impacts of climate change increasing evaporation rates in resevoirs.<br>

        <p>
         Source: <a href="https://www.globalwater.online/global-water/index.html">Global Water Monitor</a><br><br>
        <b>Aims:</b><br>
            I noticed in the map above that high GDP countries in the global north tended to have reduced water stress over the past two decades while lower GDP countries in the global south often increased in water stress. 
            Therefore, I wanted examine the relationship between per capita GDP and water stress overtime in various regions of the world. I also looked at the same relationship but with water use efficiency.<br><br>
         <b>Data:</b><br>
             The data for these charts come from the UN-FAO AQUASTAT data.
             Water stress is essentually the ratio of the water a country uses to the amount it has.
             Water use efficiency a ratio of the water a country use compared to the amount it withdrawls from all sources.<br><br>
         <b>Approach:</b><br>
             In order to plot this data I used country-level data between 2001 and 2021 including their GDP per capita, water stress, water efficiency, and Total population. I then mapped each country to it's SDG region code.
             Upon uploading the data to vega I use a transformation on GDP per capita, water stress, and water efficiency before plotting. This ensured a more interpretable chart by avoiding large skews caused by outliers.
             I then created two scatter plots of log GDP per capita plotted again log water stress and log water use efficiency respectively. In each scatter plot I maximized interactivity and interpretability with several features:<br>
             Slider to allow the user interactively investigate the plot over the twenty year period;<br>
             Size to represent total population so that the user can get a sense of the number of people as well as countries impacted; <br>
             Color and an interactive a drop down menu for inter and intra SDG regions;<br>
             A regression line plotted to highlight the relationship between GDP per capita and the water statistic.
             Tooltips for individual observation detail.
             <br><br>
         <b>Challenges:</b><br>
             When I originally plotted these charts I did so with the untransformed GDP per capita, water stress and water efficiency data. 
             By the nature of this data, interpretability was challenging with most data points concentrated in the bottom left of the chart, 
             but with enough outliers particularly in the Northern Africa and Western Asia region (a region of particular interest) 
             that simplying dropping those outliers would take away from the value of the chart. Log transformations address this problem by brining outliers closer to the rest of the data thus 
             allowing me to show the primary insight of the charts the relationship between GDP per capita and the water statistics.
             Additionally the tooltip feature allows users to investigate the actual GDP per capita and water statistics so I don't feel the chart suffers much at all by not plotting the true values.<br><br>
         <b>Conclusion:</b><br>
             Due to my observations of the map, I first created the GDP per capita vs water stress chart expecting higher GDP countries to tend to have lower water stress. In most regions and in most years I found the opposite. This is explainable
             by the demands on freshwater necessitated by greater economic activity.
             To investigate further, I plotted GDP per capita against water use efficiency and found that indeed in general higher GDP countries tend to use there water more efficiency. I would hypothesize the wealthier countries are better able to afford
             and impliment water usage technologies.
             If my hypothesis from these charts are correct this means that the increased demand associated with greater economic activity are not offset by efficiency gains from better water usage technologies.

         Source: <a href="https://washdata.org/">Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) for Water Stress (WHO/UNICEF)</a><br><br>
          <b>Aims:</b><br>
            In order to better understand the variation in water access within different populations within regions, I attempted to show the split in water access between urban and rural popualations.<br><br>
         <b>Data:</b><br>
            The data for these charts come from the UN-FAO AQUASTAT data.
            AQUASTAT breaks down contribution to water stress by three sectors (Agricultural, Industrial, and Municipal) based on water withdrawn for each sector. 
            Agricultural is water used for crop irrigation, Industrial is water used for manufacturing and other economic activities, and municipal is water used for people to drink, cook, and bath with.
         <br><br>
         <b>Approach:</b><br>
             I used trelised area charts for each region with each year from 2001 to 2021 on the x-axis and the proportional contribution to water stress on the y-axis.
             Each sector's proportional contribution to water stress is represented with a different color on the area chart.
             <br><br>
         <b>Challenges:</b><br>
             Initially, I had planned to show the raw contributions to water stress for each region. The issue with this approach is that the trelis chart only allows for a single y-axis scale,
             which meant it was very difficult to see the sectoral differences in water stress in regions with low overall water stress. Instead I decided to calculate 
             the proportional contribution to water stress for each sector. I believe this proportion is the main focus of the chart and overall water stress levels are already represented in the map and scatter plot.
         <br><br>
         <b>Conclusion:</b><br>
             In most regions Agricultral water use dominates contribution to water stress. 
             The exception being the Northern American and Europe region were the industrial sector is the largest contributor. 
             This makes sense as irrigation is highly water intensive and is still one of the main economic activities in many parts of the world. Northern America and Europe economies however 
             tend to be less focused on agriculture and more on other industries.

          <b>Aims:</b><br>
            My aim with this chart is to show which sectors contribute most to water stress across different regions over time.<br><br>
         <b>Data:</b><br>
             The data for these charts come from the Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) for Water Stress (WHO/UNICEF).
             JMP categorizes water access into tiers: Safely managed, At least basic, Limited (meaning people must travel at least 30 minutes for clean water), Unimproved, and Surface water<br><br>
         <b>Approach:</b><br>
             I used a stacked bar chart the show the porportion of both the urban and rural populations in each SDG region with each tier of water access. 
             For added context on change overtime, included an interactive slider allowing the user to adjust the year.
             I also used tooltips for details on each obervation.
             <br><br>
         <b>Challenges:</b><br>
            The JMP dataset had some limitations due to missing data. For a small number of countries in some years statistics were available either for only the total population, only the urban population or only the rural population, or none at all.
            To handle this, country-years with no observations were dropped and country-years with partial data were assumed parity for urban and rural populations. 
            Because country-years with incomplete data were a small number cases I believe the chart is overall representative of each region.<br><br>
         <b>Conclusion:</b><br>
             In all SDG regions (except Australia and New Zealand) rural populations struggle more with water access than urban populations. Though improvements have been made over time.

        <h2>Analytical Challenges</h2>
            <p>
             While developing the project, I faced several analytical challenges. 
             One of the primary issues was dealing with missing or inconsistent data. 
             For instance, missing values in the Global Water Monitor dataset initially appeared as zeros, requiring me to clean and eliminate these data points before visualization. 
             In the case of the AQUASTAT dataset, discrepancies in country names between the data and geoJSON files necessitated the use of the Python package pycountry to reconcile the names and ensure accurate geographic mapping. 
             Additionally, creating visualizations for both urban and rural water access required careful consideration of how to represent proportional contributions to water stress, as trellised charts could not use different y-axes for different sectors. 
             Despite these challenges, I was able to produce meaningful and interactive visualizations.
            </p>

<section>
        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
             The project highlights the growing pressure on water resources, particularly in regions such as Northern Africa and Western Asia, where water stress is most severe.
             Over the past two decades, many countries have seen an increase in water stress, exacerbated by population growth, economic expansion, and the effects of climate change. 
             A key observation is that wealthier countries tend to have higher water use efficiency, though the demand for water in these regions often outweighs the efficiency gains. 
             The project also confirms that rural populations in most regions face greater challenges in accessing freshwater compared to urban populations. 
             Overall, the findings emphasize the need for targeted policy interventions to alleviate water stress and ensure equitable access to water, particularly in the most vulnerable regions.
